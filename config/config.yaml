# here we give details about our marker sets.  Note that a marker
# set can be both genome-focused and target_fasta-focused, as
# I have done with ROSA here, just for an example.

# Note also that we have allowed for two different target_fastas
# for ROSA which will give us two different possible ROSA sets, possibly.
# It seemed like that would be good in order to test different
# target_fastas side-by-side, etc.

# Also, each target_fasta is assumed to belong to only one marker_set,
# but a particular full genome can belong to multiple marker sets.

# And we can map a marker set to more than one full genome...as the
# LFAR example with a genome called "nookie2" shows.
