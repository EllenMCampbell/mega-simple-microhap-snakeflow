Error in rule coverage_full:
    jobid: 0
    output: coverage/samples/CHLFAR3_cov_full.tsv
    shell:
        rm -f coverage/samples/CHLFAR3_cov_full.tsv; bedtools coverage -a bedfiles/regions_full.bed -b extracted_reads/CHLFAR3.bam | awk -v SM=CHLFAR3 '{printf("%s	%s
", SM, $0);}' >> coverage/samples/CHLFAR3_cov_full.tsv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job coverage_full since they might be corrupted:
coverage/samples/CHLFAR3_cov_full.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
